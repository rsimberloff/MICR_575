## A bit of text

Here's some text that I wrote. It isn't much, but at least I know how to **bold** and *italicize* things.

[This Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63691866/underline-in-rmarkdown-to-microsoft-word) suggests using <span style="text-decoration:underline"> this html5 workaround </span>.
