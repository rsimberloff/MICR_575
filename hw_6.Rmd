#### Description
This is a scatterplot (`geom_point`) with a regression line (`geom_smooth`).

Each point represents a vocalized phrase by a gibbon.
* *x*-axis is mapped to the number of notes in a phrase (continuous data, log-transformed)
* *y*-axis is mapped to the mean duration of notes in the phrase (continuous data, log-transformed)
* Point color is mapped to the individual gibbon who made the phrase (categorical data, un-ordered)

#### Evaluation

**Why is it bad?**  
*Too many colors.*  
The authors have given each of **13** different factor levels a different color. As Wilke points out, qualitative color scales work best when there are 3 to 5 colors. Here, it's barely possible to distinguish the different levels, and matching each point to a color in the legend involves a lot of squinting and uncertainty. This is worsened by their decision to make the points transparent.

*Poor color choice.*  
*(A) Ordered color scale for un-ordered categories.*  
This plot uses a sequential color palette for a categorical variable with no inherent order. This is visually misleading us about the relationship of the factor levels, and also makes it nearly impossible to distinguish the individual colors. This exacerbates the issue with the number of colored levels, as it means the neighboring colors are extremely similar. If they *had* to map color to individual, they at least should have chosen colors as dissimilar as possible (e.g. the "qualitative" ColorBrewer sets).


*(B) Colors fail to distinguish between two overarching categories.*  
If they wanted to do something actually useful with color, the authors could have distinguished between individuals from the two sites. This plot suggests that the two sites are showing very different patterns, but it's impossible to tell with the current color mapping. They could have mapped each site to a color, even if they kept different colors for each individual (e.g. "D" gibbons could be shades of blue and "M" gibbons shades of red.)


*Overplotting.*  
The authors tried to address overplotting by reducing the alpha of the points, but this was not very successful. Overplotting is exacerbated by the color choice (extremely similar colors) and the data structure (*x*-axis values are integers). As a result, it's impossible to tell how many data points are represented in the plot. They should have reduced the size of the points. reducing point alpha could be an effective solution if they fixed the color problem.

*"Telling a story and making a point"*  
From the text, it seems the authors intended this plot to make the point that note duration decreases as the number of notes in a phrase increases ("Menzerath's Law, tah-dah!"). However, I don't think the plot communicates this effectively -- it mostly made me question their analysis & data set. 


**Why is it wrong?**  
*Linear axis labels for log-transformed data.*  
The authors are showing log-transformed data but don't seem to have changed the *x*-axis ticks & labels? This is particularly noticeable because "number of notes in a phrase" can only have integer values. As-is, the plot implies that you can have a fraction of a note, which is meaningless here.


*Mystifying axis labels*  
The transformation should be included in the axis label, not just the caption. The *x*-axis starts at "0", and implies that a phrase with no notes at all somehow has a high mean note duration. The *y*-axis suggests that phrase duration is somehow negative. You can figure out what the authors mean from the caption, but the plot as it stands is inaccurate.
