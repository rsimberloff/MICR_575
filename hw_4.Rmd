## Setup
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Exercises
#### Exercise 1
``` {r}
a <- 3  ## a gets the value 3
b <- 2  ## b gets the value 2
a+b  ## print a + b
```

#### Exercise 2
``` {r}
sum(a,b)
```

#### Exercise 3

First I subset the `flights` dataframe using the `dplyr` function `filter()`.
``` {r}
(AA_flights <- filter(flights, carrier == "AA"))  ## creates a new dataframe with only American Airlines flights
```

Now I can make a scatterplot of arrival delay versus departure delay for only American Airlines flights:
```{r}
ggplot(data = AA_flights) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay), size = 0.5 ,alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(subtitle = "American Airlines flights that departed from NYC in 2013",
       x = "Departure delay (minutes)", 
       y = "Arrival delay (minutes)")
```
